1. Acquisition
	* Complementary data collection
	* Choose files (graph)
	* Cleaning (if required)
	* Preprocessing (build graph if not already given, adjacency matrix, ...)
2. Exploration
	* Network properties
		* Degree Distribution √
		* connected components √
		* sparsity √
		* diameter √
		* Spectral graph theory
	* Network model:
		* Identify type of graph
		* Properties of the nodes (clustering coeff, modularity, centrality)
	* Signal (attributes):
		* distribution
		* smoothness
		* Fourier transform
3. Exploitation
	* Tools use:
		* Questions:
			-> Is it possible to predict a phenotype based on genetic ?
		* clustering
		* regularisation
		* dimensionality reduction
		* graph filters
		* graph neural networks
	* Critical evaluation
		* baseline / existing work
		* limitations
	* Beyond tools
		* Predict gene phenotype percentage!!
4. Communication
	* report
		* structure
		* content
	* oral pres
	* github repo: README, LICENSE, documented, organization (notebooks and python modules),
	 	reproducible, good coding practice (comments, docstrings)
	* (publish interactive visualization)
