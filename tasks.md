1. Acquisition
	* Complementary data collection
	* Choose files (graph)
	* Cleaning (if required)
	* Preprocessing (build graph if not already given, adjacency matrix, ...)
2. Exploration
	* Network properties
		* Degree Distribution
		* Connected components
		* Sparsity
		* Diameter
		* Spectral graph theory
	* Network model:
		* Identify type of graph
		* Properties of the nodes (clustering coeff, modularity, centrality)
	* Signal (attributes):
		* Distribution
		* Smoothness
		* Fourier transform
3. Exploitation
	* Tools use:
		* Clustering
		* Regularization
		* Dimensionality reduction
		* Graph filters
		* Graph neural networks
	* Critical evaluation
		* Baseline / existing work
		* Limitations
	* Beyond tools
4. Communication
	* Report
		* Structure
		* Content
	* Rral pres
	* GitHub repo: README, LICENSE, documented, organization (notebooks and python modules),
	 	reproducible, good coding practice (comments, docstrings)
	* (publish interactive visualization)
